## ðŸŽ¯ Session Checklist

### **Before Each Session:**
- [ ] Wait 5-10 minutes from last session
- [ ] Check Google Drive space (need ~100MB free)
- [ ] Ensure stable internet connection
- [ ] Runtime â†’ Restart runtime

### **During Each Session:**
- [ ] Run setup cells (session manager + quick setup)
- [ ] Check progress (current episode count)
- [ ] Start training loop
- [ ] Monitor progress bar
- [ ] Session auto-stops after 40 minutes

### **After Each Session:**
- [ ] Check final checkpoint saved
- [ ] Note session performance (Sharpe ratio)
- [ ] Close Colab tab
- [ ] Wait before next session

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**"Runtime disconnected"**
- Normal for free tier
- Progress is automatically saved
- Just restart and continue

**"GPU not available"**
- Try different times of day
- Free tier has usage limits
- CPU training still works (slower)

**"Drive space full"**
- Clean up old checkpoints
- Each checkpoint is ~50MB
- Keep only recent ones

**"Session seems stuck"**
- Check progress bar movement
- Free tier can be slower
- Be patient, it's working

### **Performance Issues:**

**"Sharpe ratio not improving"**
- Normal in early sessions
- Improvement comes gradually
- Trust the process

**"Training seems slow"**
- Free tier has limitations
- 80 episodes per session is realistic
- Quality over speed
