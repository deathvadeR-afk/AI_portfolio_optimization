- **Assets**: ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM', 'TLT', 'GLD', 'VNQ', 'EFA', 'EEM']

## Integration Steps Completed
1. ✅ Downloaded model files from Google Drive
2. ✅ Verified file integrity
3. ✅ Loaded model architecture
4. ✅ Tested inference
5. ✅ Updated working_api.py
6. ✅ Created integration summary

## Usage
The trained RL model is now available in your API when `rl_ppo` strategy is selected.
The model will provide optimized portfolio weights based on market conditions.

## Next Steps
1. Test the API with RL strategy
2. Compare performance with rule-based strategies
3. Monitor model performance in production
4. Consider retraining with more recent data
